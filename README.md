# Privacy Policy for Octomood 🐙

**Effective Date:** January 7, 2026

At Octomood, we value your privacy and believe that your emotional data belongs to you. This policy explains how we handle your data when you use the app.

## 1. Data Collection

Octomood offers two modes of operation:

### Local Mode (No Account)
- **Data Stored:** Mood logs, notes, and app settings.
- **Location:** All data is stored locally on your device using Apple's standard storage (`UserDefaults`).
- **Access:** We do not have access to this data. If you delete the app, this data is deleted unless backed up to your personal iCloud.

### Cloud Sync Mode (With Account)
- **Data Stored:** Email address (for authentication), mood logs, and notes.
- **Provider:** Data is securely stored using **Supabase** (a cloud backend provider).
- **Purpose:** To allow you to sync your moods across multiple devices.

## 2. Third-Party Integrations

### iOS Calendar
- If you enable "Sync with Calendar," Octomood will request permission to create events in a separate "Mood Tracker" calendar on your device.
- We do not read your other calendar events.

### Supabase
- If you use Cloud Sync, your email and mood data are stored on Supabase servers. You can read their privacy policy at [supabase.com/privacy](https://supabase.com/privacy).

## 3. Data Deletion
- **Local Mode:** Simply delete the app to remove all data.
- **Cloud Mode:** You can delete your account and associated data through the app's settings or by contacting the developer.
